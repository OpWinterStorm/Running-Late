	b. Levels and bosses for each character:
		i. Journalist: --------------------------------------------------------------------------
			1. Farmland: Very early morning.  You live at a farm outside of the city. - - - -
				a. Cozy Cottage   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. You see the bus pull aways as you wake up. In this level, you 
must run out of your pleasant cottage in the mountains. Occassionally there will be a pick-up that drives 
by that you mus avoid, limbs fallen on the road, and low-hanging limbs you can either jump over or duck 
under. 
				b. Delightful Drive  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. More open land, you are now in a very rural area. It has a few 
more cars, but you no longer need to worry about limbs- you must jump over pot holes and duck under the 
occassional big-rig truck. It is still rather dark out. 
				c. Lovely Lake -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. This around a lake. You again have to worry about limbs and 
such, but not so much cars, as you have gone off the road to take a short-cut. There can also be boggy 
ground, which can slow you down. 
				d. Happy Highway  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. Back on the road again, but now it's a two-lane highway. Pot 
holes and big-rigs are more frequent, and there are a couple more cars. 
				e. Byram's Barn   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. You've decided to take another short-cut: through the back of 
Old Man Byram's farm. He thinks you're a robber, here to steal his 'prized cluckers'. A chase ensues. He 
is on his tractor, throwing bales of hay at you, as well as pigs, 'cluckers', and other assorted farm-
related items. His aim is slightly off, and he doesn't throw much, though. Once you have gotten him out 
of the screen you have 'escaped'. If he catches you, you must restart. 
			2. Small Town: Sunrise - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
				a. Peachy Prairie   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. You begin to enter more populated area by crossing through a 
peach farm on the way from Old Man Byram's farm. Irrigation canals provide hazardous footing, while the 
occassional tractor or harvesting machine is also dangerous. 
				b. Tranquil Town -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. You leave the farm and come out in a quaint small town. Cars 
are more frequent, but you don't need to worry about them when in raised areas with a sidewalk. Mail 
boxes are also a problem, as are trash cans.
				c. Rad Row -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. Similar to the last one, just more stores, and American flags 
that can get in the way when you jump. 
				d. Splendid Square  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. Lots of people, no cars, lots of trash cans and a fountain, 
and bushes. 
				e. Swell Station -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
					i. After running through the city square so recklessly, you are 
chased by the police for being a public nuisance. The head officer drives an old-style police car and 
throws donuts and coffee at you. Can also send dogs after you. Same rules as with the following boss. 
			3. Suburban Neighborhood: Morning  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
				a. Little Lane   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

Angry that you could have injured her prodigies, and angry you made her late, the only sensible thing to 
do is by chasing after you. She sends her star athlete's after you, and they can kick balls and things at 
you.
